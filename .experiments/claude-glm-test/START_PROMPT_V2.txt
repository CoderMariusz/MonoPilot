Execute Epic 01-Settings pilot using HYBRID V2 (Parallel + GLM).

Stories: 01.2 (User Roles), 01.3 (Permissions), 01.4 (Org Profile)

Use PARALLEL execution (like MASTER-PROMPT):
- Launch multiple stories per phase simultaneously
- Agents use GLM-4.7 internally for P2/P3/P7 (transparent)
- Claude for P1/P5/P6 (strategic + quality gates)

Phase sequence:
P1: All 3 stories parallel (ux-designer)
P2: All 3 stories parallel (test-writer → GLM-4.7 internal)
P3: All 3 stories parallel (backend-dev → GLM-4.7 internal)
P5: All 3 stories parallel (code-reviewer → Claude)
P3 iter2: Bug fixes parallel (backend-dev → GLM)
P5 iter2: Re-review parallel (code-reviewer → APPROVED)
P6: All 3 stories parallel (qa-agent → Claude)
P7: All 3 stories parallel (tech-writer → GLM-4.5-Air internal)

After completion:
python .experiments/claude-glm-test/scripts/hybrid_monitor.py --stories 01.2,01.3,01.4 --action report

Expected:
- Cost: ~$0.60 (vs $1.31 Claude-only = 54% savings)
- Time: ~2h (parallel execution)
- Quality: 10/10 ACs per story

START. Launch P1 for all 3 stories in PARALLEL (single message).
