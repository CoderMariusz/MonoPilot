# Story 3.4: Quality Dashboard — REMOVED

## Status: REMOVED

This story has been removed from the project scope.

### Reason
The Quality Dashboard depended on LM Review data (TECH sheet for technical faults, Paperworkerrors sheet for paperwork errors). With the removal of the LM Review file as a data source, the tech fault and paperwork error data is no longer available.

### Data Sources No Longer Available
- LM Review TECH sheet (technical faults by category)
- LM Review Paperworkerrors sheet (paperwork errors by type)

### Impact
- Navigation sidebar: "Quality" item removed
- Overview dashboard: "Tech Faults" KPI card replaced with "Cases Produced"
- Line Leader Performance (Story 3.2): Grade criteria simplified to exclude tech faults

### Future Consideration
If quality data becomes available through another data source in the future, this story can be reinstated.
