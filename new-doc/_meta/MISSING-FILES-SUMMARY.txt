POTENTIALLY-MISSED (15 files - RECOMMEND REVIEW)
================================================

These files are in the docs/ root level and may be:
  a) Legacy documentation (superseded by new-doc/)
  b) Still active (should be consolidated)
  c) Archived (should not be in docs/)

ACTION REQUIRED: Review each file to determine status.


ENTRY POINT DOCUMENTATION (1 file)
  File: docs/00-START-HERE.md
  Status: Root entry point to entire documentation
  Action: Consider copying to new-doc/_meta/00-START-HERE.md


API DOCUMENTATION (7 files - likely legacy)
  Location: docs/api/
  Files:
    1. bom-routing-costs-api.md
    2. lp-genealogy-tracking.md
    3. material-availability-check.md
    4. planning-settings-api.md
    5. po-calculation-service.md
    6. po-status-lifecycle.md
    7. quality-holds-api.md
  
  Status: May be superseded by module-specific API docs in new-doc/
  Action: Compare against new-doc/[module]/api/ files
           If still relevant, consolidate to new-doc/
           If superseded, delete or move to archive


DEVELOPER GUIDES (2 files - likely legacy)
  Location: docs/guides/
  Files:
    1. EXTRACT-API-ENDPOINTS.md

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

PRIORITY 1: Review 15 potentially-missed files

For each file:
  [ ] Does it relate to an active feature?
  [ ] Is it still accurate/current?
  [ ] Does it duplicate content already in new-doc/?
  [ ] Should it be consolidated, archived, or deleted?

Expected outcome: Add 10-14 files to new-doc/
Coverage would improve to: 94.3% (1,345 / 1,425)


PRIORITY 2: Verify API documentation completeness

  [ ] Check new-doc/[module]/api/ for completeness
  [ ] Verify all 59 API docs are present
  [ ] Compare missing docs/api/*.md files
  [ ] Consolidate or archive each


PRIORITY 3: Audit old docs/ structure (optional)

  [ ] Move docs/2-MANAGEMENT/ to docs/_archive/
  [ ] Keep only active reference docs in docs/
  [ ] This cleans up the source structure
