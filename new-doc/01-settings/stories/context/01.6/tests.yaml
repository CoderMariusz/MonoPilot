# Definition of Done
definition_of_done:
  - "10 roles seeded in database with correct permissions"
  - "hasPermission() correctly checks module + action"
  - "API middleware enforces permissions, returns 403"
  - "usePermissions hook works for UI conditional rendering"
  - "Role dropdown displays names (not codes) in user modal"
  - "Super Admin role assignment restricted to Super Admins"

  - "Unit tests for permission-service >= 80% coverage"

# Coverage Requirements
coverage:
  unit:
    target: 80
    reason: "Permission checks are security-critical"
  integration:
    target: 80
    reason: "Permission enforcement must be thoroughly tested"
  files:
    - "components/settings/users/RoleSelector.tsx: 80%"
    - "lib/hooks/usePermissions.ts: 90%"
    - "lib/services/permission-service.ts: 95%"
