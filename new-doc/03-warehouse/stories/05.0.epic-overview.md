# Epic 05 - Warehouse Module (LP-First, Production-Unblocking)

**Epic ID:** 05
**Module:** Warehouse
**Status:** STORIES TO BE CREATED
**Type:** Core Module (Inventory Foundation)
**CRITICAL:** This is THE BLOCKER for Epic 04 Production Phase 1 (10 stories waiting)

**Primary References:**
- PRD: `docs/1-BASELINE/product/modules/warehouse.md`
- Architecture: `docs/1-BASELINE/architecture/modules/warehouse.md`
- Story Brief: `docs/2-MANAGEMENT/epics/current/05-warehouse/05.0.story-creation-brief.md`
- Dependency Analysis: `docs/2-MANAGEMENT/epics/current/05-warehouse/MVP-DEPENDENCY-ANALYSIS.md`

---

## Goal

Deliver the **Warehouse Module** with **License Plate (LP) infrastructure FIRST** to unblock Epic 04 Production. This module provides:

- **License Plates (LP)** - Atomic inventory unit for full traceability
- **LP Genealogy** - Parent/child relationships (split, merge, consume, output)
- **GRN/ASN** - Goods Receipt Notes, Advanced Shipping Notices
- **Stock Movements** - Transfers, adjustments, putaway
- **FIFO/FEFO** - Pick suggestions for consumption
- **Scanner Workflows** - Mobile-first receiving, moving, picking
- **Pallet Management** - Group LPs with SSCC-18 codes
- **Inventory Management** - Cycle counts, aging, expiry alerts

**CRITICAL PRIORITY:** Phase 0 (LP Foundation) must complete FIRST to unblock Epic 04.

## CRITICAL: Production Dependency Analysis

**Epic 04 Production is BLOCKED waiting for LP infrastructure.**

### What Epic 04 Production Phase 1 Needs:

| Production Feature | Warehouse Dependency | Minimum Required |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Material Consumption (04.6a-e) | `license_plates` table | **CRITICAL** |
| Output Registration (04.7a-d) | LP creation service | **CRITICAL** |
| LP Genealogy (consumed -> output) | `lp_genealogy` table | **CRITICAL** |
| Material Reservations (04.8) | `lp_reservations` table | **CRITICAL** |
| FIFO/FEFO Picking | Pick suggestion service | **CRITICAL** |

### Stories Blocked in Epic 04:

| Story | Name | Waiting For |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 04.6a | Consumption Desktop | LP table, consumption service |
| 04.6b | Consumption Scanner | LP table, barcode lookup |
| 04.6c | 1:1 Consumption | LP consumption validation |
| 04.6d | Consumption Correction | LP qty reversal |
| 04.6e | Over-Consumption Control | LP qty validation |
