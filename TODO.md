## Architecture Decisions Made

### Backend Integration Approach
- **Decision**: Use Supabase Client directly (not Prisma) for consistency with existing pattern
- **Rationale**: Avoid over-engineering, maintain existing dual-mode pattern
- **Implementation**: Extended existing `lib/api` layer with new API classes
- **Benefit**: Seamless switching between mock and real data via feature flag

### API Layer Pattern
- **Pattern**: Dual-mode classes with static methods (like existing UsersAPI)
- **Feature Flag**: `shouldUseMockData()` function controls mock vs Supabase
- **Consistency**: All new API classes follow same pattern as existing code

### Security Approach
- **RLS**: Basic Row Level Security with read/write permissions
- **Future**: Role-based policies can be added in Phase 15
- **Audit**: All cancel actions create audit events for tracking

### Business Rules Implementation
- **Frontend Guards**: UI-level validation for immediate user feedback
- **Backend Validation**: RPC functions enforce business rules server-side
- **Audit Trail**: All business rule violations and changes are logged
- **Status Management**: Comprehensive status-based access control

---

## Current Status
- ✅ **Phase 0-14**: Fully implemented and tested
- 🔄 **Phase 15**: Future enhancements (RBAC, advanced features)
- 📋 **Ready for**: Supabase migration deployment and production testing

## Next Steps
1. Deploy SQL migrations to Supabase (001_planning_tables.sql, 002_rls_policies.sql, 003_phase14_schema.sql, 004_phase14_rpc_functions.sql)
2. Test with `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=false` to verify Supabase integration
3. Implement Phase 15 RBAC when user roles are defined
4. Add Phase 15 advanced features as needed
5. Create modal components for Supplier and Warehouse CRUD operations
