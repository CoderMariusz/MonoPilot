# BOM Component Save Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem
BOM components were not being saved when added to products in the Technical module. When users added BOM components to Finished Goods or Process products, the components would be lost upon save.

## Root Cause
1. **Type Mismatch**: The `UpdateProductData` type in `types.ts` did not include a `bom_items` field
2. **Missing Handler Logic**: The `updateProduct` and `addProduct` functions in `clientState.ts` did not handle `bom_items` from the payload
3. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The modal was sending `bom_items` but the Product type uses `activeBom` structure

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `types.ts`
Added `bom_items` field to `UpdateProductData` interface:
```typescript
export interface UpdateProductData {
  // ... existing fields
  bom_items?: Array<{
    material_id: number;
    quantity: number;
    uom: string;
    sequence?: number;
    priority?: number;
  }>;
}
```

### 2. Updated `clientState.ts` - `addProduct` function
- Extracts `bom_items` from the payload
- Creates a BOM structure with proper IDs
- Creates BomItems from the provided data
- Sets the `activeBom` property on the product

### 3. Updated `clientState.ts` - `updateProduct` function
- Extracts `bom_items` from the updates
- Preserves existing BOM ID if available
- Updates or creates BomItems
- Handles BOM removal when `bom_items` is empty

## How It Works

### When Creating a Product with BOM:
1. User adds BOM components in AddItemModal
2. Modal sends payload with `bom_items` array
3. `addProduct` creates BOM and BomItems structures
4. Product is saved with `activeBom` containing the components

### When Updating a Product:
1. User modifies BOM components in AddItemModal
2. Modal sends updates with `bom_items` array
3. `updateProduct` updates the BOM structure
4. Existing BOM ID is preserved, BomItems are recreated

### When Loading a Product:
1. Product has `activeBom` with `bomItems`
2. Modal reads from `activeBom.bomItems`
3. Components are displayed correctly

## Testing Verification
✅ Code compiles successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Frontend workflow running without errors
✅ Mock data structure supports the fix

## Files Modified
1. `apps/frontend/lib/types.ts` - Added `bom_items` to UpdateProductData
2. `apps/frontend/lib/clientState.ts` - Updated addProduct and updateProduct functions

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- BOM components are properly saved when products are created
- BOM components are properly updated when products are edited
- BOM components persist and display correctly when products are reopened
- All BOM data (material_id, quantity, uom, sequence, priority) is preserved
