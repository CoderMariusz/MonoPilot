# MonoPilot Implementation Summary

## ✅ Automated Database Seeding Complete!

**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Project**: MonoPilot - Manufacturing ERP System  
**Supabase Project**: `pgroxddbtaevdegnidaz`

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: UI Fixes ✅
- **Fixed ID type mismatch** in `WorkOrderDetailsModal.tsx`
  - Issue: `workOrderId` (number) was being compared with `wo.id` (string)
  - Solution: Added proper type conversion using `workOrderId?.toString()`
- **Verified** `PurchaseOrderDetailsModal` and `TransferOrderDetailsModal` had correct ID handling

### Phase 2: Database Migrations ✅
- **Applied core migrations** using MCP Supabase tools:
  - ✅ `001_planning_tables.sql` - Core tables (products, BOMs, work orders, POs, TOs, GRNs)
  - ✅ `003_phase14_schema.sql` - Warehouses, locations, production outputs
  - ✅ Additional tables created: tax_codes, allergens, machines, routings, license_plates, stock_moves, etc.

### Phase 3: Database Seeding ✅
Successfully populated the database with **realistic test data** using automated MCP Supabase execution:

#### Master Data
- ✅ **5 Suppliers** (ABC Meats Ltd, Fresh Produce Co, Spice World Ltd, etc.)
- ✅ **3 Warehouses** (Main, Cold Storage, Production Floor)
- ✅ **15 Locations** across all warehouses
- ✅ **3 Tax Codes** (Standard 20%, Reduced 5%, Zero 0%)
- ✅ **14 Allergens** (Gluten, Dairy, Nuts, Eggs, Soy, etc.)
- ✅ **5 Machines** (Grinder, Mixer, Sausage Line, Packaging, Labeling)

#### Product Catalog
- ✅ **23 Products**:
  - 10 Raw Materials (Beef, Pork, Salt, Pepper, Spices, Fat, Casings, Onion, Garlic, Paper)
  - 5 Intermediate Products (Ground Beef Mix, Seasoned Mix, Sausage Filling, Cooked Sausage, Chilled Product)
  - 8 Finished Goods (Beef Sausage, Pork Sausage, Mixed Sausage, Burger Patties, Ground Beef, Steak, Chicken)

#### Manufacturing Data
- ✅ **8 BOMs** (one per finished good)
- ✅ **11 BOM Items** with material requirements
- ✅ **5 Routings** with production operations
- ✅ **10 Supplier-Product relationships** with pricing

#### Planning & Orders
- ✅ **2 Purchase Orders** (1 confirmed, 1 submitted)
- ✅ **5 PO Items** with quantities and prices
- ✅ **1 Transfer Order** (completed)
- ✅ **4 Work Orders** (1 planned, 1 released, 1 in_progress, 1 completed)

#### Warehouse & Production
- ✅ **1 GRN** (Goods Receipt Note) linked to PO-2024-001
- ✅ **6 License Plates** (4 raw materials, 2 finished goods)
- ✅ **5 Stock Moves** (receipts, transfers, consumption, outputs)
- ✅ **1 Production Output** from completed work order
- ✅ **2 LP Genealogy** records for traceability

### Phase 4: Documentation ✅
- ✅ Created `SEED_DATA_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive testing instructions
- ✅ Created `seed_database.sql` with full seed data
- ✅ Created `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this document)

## 🧪 Test Scenarios Enabled

### Scenario 1: Complete Production Flow
**PO-2024-001 → GRN-2024-001 → LP-2024-001 → WO-2024-004 → LP-2024-005**

- Purchase Order received
- GRN created with license plates
- Work Order consumes raw materials
- Finished goods produced
- Full traceability chain

### Scenario 2: Warehouse Operations
- **Transfer Order TO-2024-001**: Materials moved from Main Warehouse to Cold Storage
- **Stock Moves**: Track all material movements
- **License Plates**: Multiple LPs with different statuses

### Scenario 3: Planning Operations
- **Work Orders**: Various statuses (planned, released, in_progress, completed)
- **Purchase Orders**: Different states (confirmed, submitted)
- **BOM Management**: Products with bill of materials

## 📝 Known Limitations

### Routing Operations
- The existing schema uses `seq_no` and `name` instead of `sequence` and `operation_name`
- Routing operations were not fully seeded due to schema differences
- This doesn't affect core functionality but may impact advanced routing features

### Work Order Operations
- The existing `wo_operations` schema is different from the seed data expectations
- Uses `routing_operation_id` instead of inline operation data
- Production outputs and genealogy still work correctly

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Modal Buttons Don't Work
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify data loaded in tables
3. Test with different work orders/purchase orders
4. Check network tab for API calls

### If Data Doesn't Show
1. Verify Supabase connection in `.env`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://pgroxddbtaevdegnidaz.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-key>
   ```
2. Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA` is NOT set to `true`
3. Verify database has data using Supabase dashboard

### If APIs Return Errors
1. Check Supabase RLS policies are set correctly
2. Verify user is authenticated
3. Check API endpoint logs in browser developer tools
