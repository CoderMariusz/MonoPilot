## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

The current Production Module (`/production`) uses a **tab-based interface** (5 tabs: Work Orders, Yield, Consume, Operations, Trace) that requires extensive navigation and manual analysis. Production Managers spend **8-10 minutes** each morning reviewing production status by switching between tabs, opening Excel for calculations, and making phone calls to Line Supervisors. Line Supervisors walk to the office computer **28 times per shift** (1.68 km total) to check status, leading to **30+ minute lag** in issue detection.

**Key Pain Points**:
- No central dashboard (need 5 tabs to see full picture)
- No real-time updates (5-10 min data lag)
- No OEE tracking (manual calculation in Excel)
- No downtime tracking (end-of-shift Excel entry)
- No visual alerts (issues buried in tables)
- Not mobile-friendly (supervisors tied to office computer)
- No shop floor visibility (operators have no awareness of metrics)

### Solution Overview

A **3-variant UX redesign** of the Production Module, prioritized for phased implementation:

1. **Variant B: Real-Time Production Board** (P0 MVP, Weeks 1-6)
   - Single-screen dashboard with 10 KPI cards + 4-column Kanban-style line board
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket (30-second refresh)
   - WO Details Modal with 6 tabs (Overview, Operations, Materials, Yield, Trace, History)
   - Downtime Tracker Modal with auto-calculated impact
   - Mobile/tablet view for Line Supervisors (1280×800)
   - **Time Savings**: 83% faster morning review (8 min → 50s), 97% time saved on shift monitoring (98 min → 2 min)

2. **Variant C: KPI Focus Mode / TV Display** (P0 Growth, Weeks 7-9)
   - Full-screen TV display (1920×1080, 50" TVs) for shop floor visibility
   - Auto-rotating 6 screens (OEE, Yield, Plan Accuracy, Running WOs, Delayed WOs, Shortages)
   - 120px font sizes (readable from 10+ meters)
   - Red flash alerts for critical events
   - **Impact**: 100% operator awareness (vs 0% currently)

3. **Variant D: Customizable Widgets** (P2 Future, Weeks 10-12)
   - Drag-drop widget dashboard (react-grid-layout)
   - 10 widget types (OEE Gauge, Yield Trend, WO List, Downtime Log, etc.)
   - Custom SQL widget for ad-hoc analysis
   - Pre-built templates (Production Manager View, Line Supervisor View, etc.)
   - **Users**: Power users (20% adoption target)

### Business Impact

**Quantitative Benefits**:
- **175 minutes/day saved** across Production Manager + Line Supervisors (750 hours/year)
- **83% faster** morning review (8 min → 50s)
- **97% time saved** on shift monitoring (98 min → 2-3 min passive)
- **93% faster** downtime logging (5 min → 20s)
- **75% faster** WO investigation (10 min → 2.5 min)
- **60x faster** issue detection (30+ min lag → <30s real-time)

**Qualitative Benefits**:
- Real-time visibility (live indicator, <30s updates)
- Proactive issue detection (alerts before problems escalate)
- Operator engagement (shop floor TVs create feedback loop)
- Shift handoff accuracy (auto-generated summaries, 100% complete vs 60-70% memory-based)
- Reduced physical movement (0 office trips vs 28/shift = 1.68 km eliminated)

### Implementation Summary

- **Timeline**: 12 weeks (3 months)
- **Budget**: $73,450 ($72k labor + $1.5k hardware)
- **Team**: 2 developers (60% time), 1 designer (50%), 1 QA (25%), 1 PM (10%)
- **Technology**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Realtime), Tailwind CSS, Recharts
- **Deliverables**: 10 components, 5 API routes, 3 database tables, 80+ tests, 2 TVs deployed

---

## Current State Analysis

### Current UI Structure (Tab-Based)

**File**: `apps/frontend/app/production/page.tsx` (1,075 lines)

**5 Tabs**:

1. **Work Orders Tab** (Lines 81-360)
   - Table: WO#, Product, Line, Status, Priority, Scheduled Start/End, Actual Start/End, Quantity, Progress
   - Filters: Line, Status, Date Range
   - Actions: View Details, Start WO, Complete WO
   - **Pain Point**: No real-time updates, need to refresh page

2. **Yield Report Tab** (Lines 362-610)
   - 4 KPI Cards: Yield %, Consumption/kg, Plan Accuracy, On-Time WO%
   - PR/FG toggle
   - Time bucket selector (day/week/month)
   - Drill-down table: WO#, Product, Input, Output, Yield%, Variance
   - Export to Excel
   - **Pain Point**: No charts, just tables. No trend analysis.

3. **Consume Report Tab** (Lines 612-816)
   - 4 Summary Cards: Total Materials, Unique Materials, Work Orders, Total Variance
   - Material Variance Analysis table: Material, BOM Standard, Actual, Variance, Variance %
   - Filter by WO
   - **Pain Point**: No real-time alerts for over-consumption

4. **Operations Tab** (Lines 818-1074)
   - Select WO dropdown
   - Operations table: Seq, Operation Name, Planned IN/OUT, Actual IN/OUT, Losses, Yield%, Operator
   - RecordWeightsModal integration
   - **Pain Point**: Must select WO one at a time, no overview

5. **Trace Tab** (Lines 1075-end)
   - Search: LP number or WO number
   - Forward/Backward toggle
   - Tree visualization (indented nodes)
   - Node details panel
   - **Pain Point**: Separate tab, not integrated with WO view

**Current User Workflows**:

| Task | Steps | Time | Issues |
|------|-------|------|--------|
| Morning Review | Click 5 tabs, scan tables, open Excel, calculate | 8-10 min | Manual, slow, error-prone |
| Check WO Status | Click Work Orders tab, scroll table, find WO | 30-60s | No visual indicators |
| Investigate Yield Issue | Click Yield tab, find WO in table, click Operations tab, select WO, review | 5 min | 3 tab switches |
| Record Downtime | Walk to office, open Excel, type notes, calculate duration | 5+ min | Manual, not in system |
| Shift Handoff | Verbal + handwritten notes | 15-20 min | Incomplete, memory-based |

### Pain Points Summary

1. **No Central Dashboard**: Need 5 tabs to see full picture
2. **No Real-Time Updates**: 5-10 min data lag, must refresh page
3. **No OEE Tracking**: Manual calculation in Excel
4. **No Downtime Tracking**: End-of-shift Excel entry, data loss risk
5. **No Visual Alerts**: Issues buried in tables, easy to miss
6. **Not Mobile-Friendly**: Supervisors tied to office computer
7. **No Shop Floor Visibility**: Operators have no awareness of metrics
8. **Excessive Context Switching**: 5 tabs + Excel + phone calls

- Supervisors manually tell operators (intermittent, delayed)
- End-of-shift meeting reviews metrics (too late to correct)

**Result**: Reactive, no real-time feedback

#### New Method (Continuous Awareness)

**Auto-Rotate Sequence (60 seconds loop)**:

| Screen | Display | Duration | Purpose |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | OEE % (82.5%, green gauge) | 10s | Overall effectiveness |
| 2 | Yield % (78.5%, amber gauge) | 10s | Production efficiency |
| 3 | Plan Accuracy (92%, green) | 10s | Schedule adherence |
| 4 | Running WOs (6 WOs, progress bars) | 10s | Active production |
| 5 | Delayed WOs (2 WOs, reasons) | 10s | Issues needing attention |
| 6 | Material Shortages (1, ETA) | 10s | Supply chain issues |

**Loop repeats**: 6 screens × 10s = 60s full cycle

**Alert Behavior**:
- Critical alert detected → pause rotation
- Red flash (500ms on/off, 5× repeat)
- Hold screen 30 seconds
- Resume when dismissed

**Impact**:
- 100% operator awareness (vs 0% currently)
- Behavioral change (visible goals)
- Faster communication (fewer supervisor questions)

---

2. Verbal handoff (300s)
   - "Line A had yield issues..."
   - "WO-0107 delayed, waiting for beef..."
   - Relies on memory, incomplete
3. Night supervisor takes handwritten notes (180s)
4. Day supervisor leaves
5. Night supervisor reviews notes, has questions (60s)
6. **Info lost** (day supervisor gone)

**Total**: ~15-20 min, incomplete, memory-based

#### New Method (2 minutes)

1. Day supervisor taps "Shift Summary" button (1s)
2. System generates report (3s, AI-powered)
   - Auto-populated from database:
     - Shift Overview (output, OEE, WO counts, downtime)
     - Issues & Actions (low yield, shortages, downtimes)
     - Material Status (beef low, spices OK, casings OK)
     - Night Shift Priorities (resume WO-0107 at 18:00, monitor WO-0105 yield, schedule Line C maintenance)
3. Day supervisor reviews (30s)
4. Add manual note: "Watch Op2 closely" (10s)
5. Tap "Share with Night Shift" (1s)
6. Report auto-sent to Tomasz (1s)
