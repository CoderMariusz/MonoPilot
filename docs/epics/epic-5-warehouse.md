## Story 5.1: License Plate Creation

As a **Warehouse user**,
I want to create license plates,
So that inventory is tracked atomically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the user navigates to /warehouse/license-plates
**When** clicking "Create LP"
**Then** modal opens with:
- lp_number (auto-generated, can override)
- product_id (required)
- qty (required)
- uom (from product)
- batch_number (required)
- manufacture_date (optional)
- expiry_date (optional)
- location_id (required)

**When** saving
**Then** LP created with status = 'available'

**Prerequisites:** Epic 1, Epic 2

**Technical Notes:**
- LP number format configurable
- API: GET/POST/PUT /api/warehouse/license-plates

---

## Story 5.2: LP Status Tracking

As a **Warehouse user**,
I want to track LP status,
So that I know availability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** LP exists
**Then** has status:
- available: can be consumed/shipped
- reserved: reserved for WO/TO
- consumed: fully consumed
- quarantine: quality hold
- shipped: sent out

**When** status changes
**Then** timestamp and user recorded

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.1

**Technical Notes:**
- Status affects availability queries

---

## Story 5.3: LP Batch/Expiry Tracking

As a **Warehouse user**,
I want to track batch and expiry,
So that I can manage FIFO/FEFO.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** LP is created
**Then** stores:
- batch_number (required)
- supplier_batch_number (optional)
- manufacture_date (optional)
- expiry_date (optional)

**When** searching LPs
**Then** can filter by expiry date
**And** expired LPs highlighted in red

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.1

**Technical Notes:**
- FEFO: First Expired First Out
- Sort by expiry_date for picking suggestions

---

## Story 5.4: LP Number Generation

As a **System**,
I want to auto-generate LP numbers,
So that they are unique and meaningful.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** new LP is created
**When** lp_number not provided
**Then** auto-generate format: LP-{date}-{sequence}

**And** sequence per day
**And** globally unique

**Admin** can configure format in Settings

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.1

**Technical Notes:**

- Example: LP-20250120-0001

---

## Story 5.5: LP Split

As a **Warehouse user**,
I want to split an LP into smaller quantities,
So that I can partially use inventory.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** LP has qty > split qty
**When** clicking "Split"
**Then** modal asks for split qty

**When** confirming
**Then** original LP qty decreased
**And** new LP created with split qty
**And** genealogy recorded: parent_lp_id = original

**And** new LP inherits: product, batch, expiry, location

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.1

**Technical Notes:**
- New LP gets new lp_number
- API: POST /api/warehouse/license-plates/:id/split

---

## Story 5.6: LP Merge

As a **Warehouse user**,
I want to merge LPs of same product/batch,
So that I can consolidate inventory.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** multiple LPs with same product and batch
**When** selecting LPs and clicking "Merge"
**Then** modal shows total qty

**When** confirming
**Then** target LP qty increased
**And** source LPs status → 'merged'
**And** genealogy recorded

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.1

**Technical Notes:**
- Validation: same product_id, batch_number
- API: POST /api/warehouse/license-plates/merge

---

## Story 5.7: LP Genealogy Tracking

As a **System**,
I want to track LP relationships,
So that traceability is complete.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** LP operations occur
**Then** lp_genealogy records:
- parent_lp_id
- child_lp_id
- wo_id (if from production)
- operation_type (split, merge, consume, produce)
- timestamp

**AC: Genealogy Integrity & Atomicity (Sprint 0 Gap 2)**

LP genealogy tracking ensures **FDA-compliant traceability** with guaranteed data integrity:

**Transaction Flow (Atomic Genealogy Creation):**

1. **START** database transaction
2. **VALIDATE** pre-conditions:
   - parent_lp_id exists in license_plates table (FK validation)
   - child_lp_id exists in license_plates table (FK validation)
   - Both LPs belong to same org_id (multi-tenant isolation)
   - wo_id exists if provided (FK validation)
   - operation_type is valid enum: 'split', 'merge', 'consume', 'produce'
   - No duplicate genealogy link (parent → child already exists)
3. **CHECK** for circular dependencies:
   - child_lp_id cannot be ancestor of parent_lp_id (prevent cycles)
   - Use recursive CTE to validate genealogy tree integrity
4. **INSERT** lp_genealogy record:
   - parent_lp_id, child_lp_id, wo_id, operation_type, created_at, created_by_user_id
5. **VERIFY** trace integrity:
   - Forward trace: parent → all descendants reachable
   - Backward trace: child → all ancestors reachable
6. **COMMIT** transaction

**Rollback Scenarios:**

**If ANY step fails** (FK violation, circular dependency, duplicate link):
- Transaction **ROLLBACK**
- **No genealogy record created** (maintain clean traceability tree)
- **Error message** displayed with specific failure reason

**Error Examples:**

| Failure Point | Error Message |
|---------------|---------------|
| Parent LP not exists | "Cannot create genealogy: Parent License Plate LP-001234 does not exist. Verify LP number." |
| Child LP not exists | "Cannot create genealogy: Child License Plate LP-005678 does not exist. Verify LP number." |
| Different orgs | "Cannot create genealogy: Parent and child LPs belong to different organizations. Cross-org genealogy not allowed." |
| Circular dependency | "Cannot create genealogy: Circular dependency detected. LP-001234 is already a descendant of LP-005678." |
| Duplicate link | "Cannot create genealogy: Link already exists between Parent LP-001234 and Child LP-005678." |
| Invalid WO | "Cannot create genealogy: Work Order #9999 does not exist or is not related to these LPs." |
| Invalid operation type | "Cannot create genealogy: Operation type 'transform' is invalid. Use: split, merge, consume, or produce." |

**FK Validation Rules (Gap 2 Critical):**

- ✅ parent_lp_id → license_plates.id (CASCADE DELETE blocked, must orphan children explicitly)
- ✅ child_lp_id → license_plates.id (CASCADE DELETE blocked)
- ✅ wo_id → work_orders.id (CASCADE DELETE blocked, genealogy is immutable audit trail)
- ✅ org_id → organizations.id (both parent and child must match)

**Trace Verification Integrity (Gap 2):**

After every genealogy insert, system verifies:

1. **Forward Traceability:**
   - FROM parent_lp → trace all descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.)
   - Verify no broken links (all descendants reachable via recursive query)
   - Use: `WITH RECURSIVE descendants AS (SELECT * FROM lp_genealogy WHERE parent_lp_id = X UNION...)`

2. **Backward Traceability:**
   - FROM child_lp → trace all ancestors (parents, grandparents, etc.)
   - Verify no broken links (all ancestors reachable via recursive query)
   - Use: `WITH RECURSIVE ancestors AS (SELECT * FROM lp_genealogy WHERE child_lp_id = X UNION...)`

3. **Orphan Detection:**
   - If parent LP is deleted → children become orphans
   - System flags orphaned LPs in UI: "⚠️ LP-005678: Parent LP-001234 no longer exists (orphaned)"
   - Orphaned LPs still tracked for audit purposes (do not cascade delete genealogy)

**Operation Type Semantics:**

| Operation Type | Parent LP | Child LP | WO Required | Use Case |
|----------------|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **split** | Original LP | New split LPs | No | Split 100kg pallet → 2x 50kg pallets |
| **merge** | Multiple source LPs | New merged LP | No | Merge 2x 50kg pallets → 1x 100kg pallet |
| **consume** | Input material LP | Output finished good LP | Yes | WO consumes Flour LP → produces Bread LP |
| **produce** | Input material LP | Output finished good LP | Yes | Same as consume (legacy alias) |

**Data Integrity Guarantees (FDA Compliance):**

- ✅ Every consumed LP → linked to output LP via genealogy (full traceability)
- ✅ Every output LP → linked to all input LPs (backward trace)
- ✅ LP split → all child LPs linked to parent (forward trace)
- ✅ LP merge → all parent LPs linked to merged child (backward trace)
- ✅ Genealogy records immutable (no DELETE, no UPDATE, only INSERT)
- ✅ No circular dependencies (tree structure enforced)
- ✅ No cross-org genealogy (multi-tenant isolation)
- ❌ NEVER: Output LP without input LP genealogy (consumption)
- ❌ NEVER: Genealogy link without valid parent AND child LPs
- ❌ NEVER: Circular dependencies (A → B → C → A)
- ❌ NEVER: Broken traces (missing intermediate links)

**Recall Simulation (Forward + Backward Trace):**

**Scenario:** Recall all products affected by contaminated Flour batch LP-001234

1. **Forward Trace (Impact Analysis):**
   ```sql
   WITH RECURSIVE descendants AS (
     SELECT child_lp_id, operation_type, wo_id, 1 AS depth
     FROM lp_genealogy WHERE parent_lp_id = 'LP-001234'
     UNION ALL
     SELECT g.child_lp_id, g.operation_type, g.wo_id, d.depth + 1
     FROM lp_genealogy g
     JOIN descendants d ON g.parent_lp_id = d.child_lp_id
     WHERE d.depth < 10 -- prevent infinite loops
   )
   SELECT DISTINCT child_lp_id FROM descendants;
   ```
   **Result:** All downstream LPs (Bread, Pastry, etc.) that used contaminated Flour

2. **Backward Trace (Root Cause Analysis):**
   ```sql
   WITH RECURSIVE ancestors AS (
     SELECT parent_lp_id, operation_type, wo_id, 1 AS depth
     FROM lp_genealogy WHERE child_lp_id = 'LP-009876' -- contaminated Bread LP
     UNION ALL
     SELECT g.parent_lp_id, g.operation_type, g.wo_id, a.depth + 1
     FROM lp_genealogy g
     JOIN ancestors a ON g.child_lp_id = a.parent_lp_id
     WHERE a.depth < 10
   )
   SELECT DISTINCT parent_lp_id FROM ancestors;
   ```
   **Result:** All upstream LPs (Flour, Yeast, etc.) that contributed to contaminated Bread

**Concurrency Handling:**
- Use unique constraint on (parent_lp_id, child_lp_id) to prevent duplicate links
- Row-level locks not required (INSERT-only operation, no UPDATEs)
- If duplicate insert attempt: Silently succeed (link already exists, idempotent)

**Audit Trail:**
- All genealogy records include created_at timestamp and created_by_user_id
- Genealogy records are NEVER deleted (immutable audit trail for FDA inspections)
- If LP is deleted, genealogy records remain (with orphan flag for broken trace detection)

**When** clicking "Receive"
**Then** GRN created
**And** for each item:
- LP created with qty, batch, expiry
- Location from warehouse default or selected
- QA status assigned

**And** GRN items linked to LPs

**AC: Transaction Atomicity (Sprint 0 Gap 6)**

GRN + LP creation is atomic (all-or-nothing guarantee):

**Transaction Flow:**
1. **START** database transaction
2. **INSERT** grn record
   - Validate FK: asn_id (if from ASN), supplier_id, warehouse_id, org_id
   - Auto-generate grn_number (GRN-YYYYMMDD-NNNN)
3. **INSERT** grn_items for each line
   - Validate FK: grn_id, product_id, org_id
4. **INSERT** license_plates for each item
   - Validate FK: grn_id, product_id, location_id, org_id
   - Auto-generate lp_number (per configured format)
   - Set initial qa_status (Pending or Passed per warehouse settings)
5. **UPDATE** asn.status → "Completed" (if GRN from ASN)
6. **UPDATE** po_line.received_qty += grn_qty (if linked to PO)
7. **COMMIT** transaction

**Rollback Scenarios:**

**If ANY step fails** (FK violation, unique constraint, validation error):
- Transaction **ROLLBACK**
- **No partial records created** (no GRN, no GRN items, no LPs, no ASN update, no PO update)
- **Error message** displayed to user with specific failure reason

**Error Examples:**

| Failure Point | Error Message |
|---------------|---------------|
| ASN not found | "Cannot create GRN: ASN #12345 no longer exists. Please refresh and try again." |
| Invalid supplier | "Cannot create GRN: Supplier is inactive or does not exist. Please select a valid supplier." |
| Invalid location | "Cannot create LP: Location 'WH-A-01' is inactive. Please select a different location." |
| Invalid product | "Cannot create LP: Product SKU 'ABC123' no longer exists. Please verify product catalog." |
| Duplicate LP# | "Cannot create LP: License Plate LP-001234 already exists. System will retry with next number." |
| PO update fails | "GRN creation aborted: Unable to update PO received quantity. Transaction rolled back." |

**Concurrency Handling:**
- Use row-level locks on ASN, PO during update (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE)
- Prevent duplicate GRN creation for same ASN (check ASN status before insert)
- If concurrent GRN attempt detected: "ASN #12345 is already being received. Please refresh."

**Data Integrity Guarantees:**
- ✅ GRN exists → All LPs exist
- ✅ LP exists → Parent GRN exists
- ✅ ASN marked Completed → GRN exists with all items
- ✅ PO received_qty updated → GRN exists
- ❌ NEVER: GRN without LPs
- ❌ NEVER: LP without GRN
- ❌ NEVER: ASN Completed without GRN
