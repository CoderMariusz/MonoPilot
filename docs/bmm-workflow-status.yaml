# Workflow Status Template

# This tracks progress through BMM methodology Analysis, Planning, and Solutioning phases.
# Implementation phase is tracked separately in sprint-status.yaml

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped
#
# CONTEXT MANAGEMENT NOTES:
# =========================
# � CRITICAL: When loading documentation for AI context, load ONLY the module you're working on.
# DO NOT load all modules simultaneously - this causes context overflow.
#
# Example: If working on Epic 6 (Quality), load ONLY:
#   - docs/epics/epic-6-quality.md
#   - docs/prd/modules/quality.md (if needed)
#   - docs/ux-design-qa-module.md (if needed)
#   - docs/architecture/modules/quality.md (if needed)
#
#  CORRECT: Load 1 epic file (~700 lines)
# L WRONG: Load all 8 epic files (~5,500 lines) - Context explosion!
#
# The modular structure exists specifically to prevent AI context overload.
# Each epic/module is self-contained and can be worked on independently.

workflow_status:
  # Phase 0: Discovery (Optional) - All skipped
  brainstorm-project: skipped  # agent: analyst
  research: skipped  # agent: analyst
  product-brief: skipped  # agent: analyst

  # Phase 1: Planning
  prd: docs/prd/index-prd.md  # agent: pm
  validate-prd: skipped  # agent: pm (optional)
  create-design: docs/ux-design-index.md  # agent: ux-designer

  # Phase 2: Solutioning
  create-architecture: docs/architecture/index-architecture.md  # agent: architect
  test-design: docs/test-design-system.md  # agent: tea
  validate-architecture: skipped  # agent: architect (optional)
  solutioning-gate-check: docs/bmm-readiness-assessment-2025-11-20.md  # agent: architect

  # Phase 3: Implementation
  # Note: Sprint 0 tracking initialized (8 critical gaps from readiness assessment)
  sprint-planning: docs/sprint-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml  # agent: sm
  epic-tech-context: docs/sprint-artifacts/tech-spec-epic-1.md  # agent: architect

  # Story implementation happens after sprint-planning creates sprint-status.yaml
  # Then use: /bmad:bmm:workflows:create-story and /bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story

# NEXT STEPS:
# ===========
# Current Phase: Solutioning (Phase 2)
# Recommended: Run test-design to assess testability before gate check
# Required: Complete solutioning-gate-check before moving to implementation
#
# After gate check passes:
# 1. Run sprint-planning to create sprint-status.yaml
# 2. Implementation begins story-by-story
#
# CONTEXT LOADING REMINDER:
# =========================
# When you start implementation:
# - Load ONLY the epic you're working on (e.g., epic-1-settings.md)
# - Each epic file contains all stories for that module
# - Work through epics sequentially to maintain context efficiency
# - After completing an epic, you can unload it and load the next
#
# Epic Loading Sequence (by dependency):
# 1. Epic 1: Settings (foundation)
# 2. Epic 2: Technical (depends on Settings)
# 3. Epic 3: Planning (depends on Settings, Technical)
# 4. Epic 5: Warehouse (depends on Settings, Planning)
# 5. Epic 4: Production (depends on Planning, Warehouse)
# 6. Epic 6: Quality (depends on Settings, Warehouse)
# 7. Epic 7: Shipping (depends on Settings, Warehouse)
# 8. Epic 8: NPD (depends on Settings, Technical)
#
# At end of each epic session, ask:
# "Context check: Is AI ready to reset and load next epic? (Current epic complete)"
