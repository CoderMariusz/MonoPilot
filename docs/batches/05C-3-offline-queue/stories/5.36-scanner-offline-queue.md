# Story 5.36a: Scanner Offline Queue - Core

**ID:** 5.36a
**Batch:** 5C-3 (Offline Queue)
**Story Points:** 8
**Effort:** 8-10 hours
**Status:** Todo
**Sprint:** 0 (Gap 5)
**Successor:** Story 5.36b (Advanced Features)

---

## User Story

> As an **Operator**, I want the scanner to queue operations while offline, so that I can continue working during network outages without losing data.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1: Offline Queue Capacity Limits

**Given** Scanner PWA is offline (network disconnected)
**And** Operator performing warehouse operations (receive, consume, move)

**When** operations are executed while offline
**Then** verify queue management:
- ✅ Operations stored in IndexedDB (browser local storage)
- ✅ Max capacity: 100 offline operations
- ⚠️ Warning at 80 operations: **"80/100 offline operations queued. Reconnect to sync soon."**
- ❌ Block at 100 operations: **"Offline queue full (100/100). Please reconnect to sync before continuing."**
- ✅ Each operation stores: operation_type, payload, timestamp, user_id, retry_count

**Operation Types Supported Offline:**
- Receive (GRN + LP creation)
- Consume (WO material consumption)
- Output (WO output recording)
- LP Move (location change)
- LP Split
- Inventory Count

**Technical Notes:**
- IndexedDB key: `scanner_offline_queue_{org_id}_{user_id}`
- Queue structure: Array of operation objects with timestamps
- Warning threshold: 80%, Block threshold: 100%

---

### AC 2: Offline Queue UI Indicators

**Given** Scanner PWA with queued offline operations

**When** viewing scanner interface
**Then** verify UI indicators:
- ✅ Network status badge: **"🔴 Offline"** (red) or **"🟢 Online"** (green)
- ✅ Queue counter badge: **"📦 Queue: 23"** (always visible when offline operations exist)
- ✅ Sync status indicator: **"⏳ Syncing..."** (during sync) or **"✅ Synced"** (when complete)
- ⚠️ Warning banner at 80 operations: **"80/100 operations queued. Reconnect to sync."**
- ❌ Error banner at 100 operations: **"Queue full. Sync required before continuing."**

**UI Placement:**
- Network status: Top-right corner (persistent)
- Queue counter: Top-center (persistent when >0 operations)
- Sync status: Top-center (during sync only)
- Warning/error banners: Full-width at top

**Technical Notes:**
- Real-time queue count updates (on every operation)
- Network status via `navigator.onLine` + periodic ping to server

---

### AC 3: Automatic Sync on Reconnect

**Given** Scanner PWA with 50 queued offline operations
**And** Network connection restored

**When** connection detected
**Then** verify automatic sync:
- ✅ Sync starts within 2 seconds of reconnection
- ✅ UI shows: **"⏳ Syncing 50 operations..."**
- ✅ Operations synced in order (FIFO: First In First Out)
- ✅ Progress indicator: **"Syncing 10/50... 20/50... 30/50..."**
- ✅ Sync completes: **"✅ All 50 operations synced successfully"**
- ✅ Queue cleared after successful sync
- ✅ IndexedDB offline queue emptied

**Sync Strategy:**
- Batch size: 10 operations per API call (for performance)
- Retry on failure: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
- If batch fails after 3 attempts: Mark operations as failed, continue with next batch

**Technical Notes:**
- API: POST /api/scanner/sync-offline-queue (bulk endpoint)
- Request payload: Array of operations (max 10 per request)
- Connection detection: `window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline)`

---

### AC 4: Queue Persistence Across App Restarts

**Given** Scanner PWA with 30 queued operations
**And** Operator closes browser/app

**When** Operator reopens scanner
**Then** verify queue persistence:
- ✅ All 30 operations still in queue (loaded from IndexedDB)
- ✅ UI shows: **"📦 Queue: 30"** (restored state)
- ✅ Operations maintain order (FIFO preserved)
- ✅ If online: Auto-sync starts within 5 seconds

**Technical Notes:**
- IndexedDB persists across app restarts (browser storage)
- On app load: Check IndexedDB for pending operations, restore queue state

---

### AC 5: Offline Operation Timestamps

**Given** Scanner PWA offline for 2 hours
**And** Operator performs 50 operations during offline period

**When** operations sync
**Then** verify timestamps:
- ✅ Each operation records: `performed_at` (when operator executed) and `synced_at` (when uploaded to server)
- ✅ Server respects `performed_at` timestamp for audit trail (not `synced_at`)
- ✅ Example: Operation performed at 10:00 AM, synced at 12:00 PM → Audit log shows 10:00 AM
- ✅ UI shows both timestamps in Failed Queue: **"Performed: 10:00 AM, Synced: 12:00 PM"**

**Technical Notes:**
- Timestamps stored in ISO 8601 format with timezone
- Server validates: `performed_at` cannot be in future

---

### AC 6: Session Timeout - Data Loss Prevention

**Given** Scanner session times out while offline operations queued
**And** Operator has pending operations in queue (not yet synced)

**When** session expires
**Then** verify data is preserved:
- ✅ Queued operations NOT lost (saved in IndexedDB before session expires)
- ✅ On re-login: Queue restored with all pending operations
- ✅ UI shows: **"📦 Queue: 15 (restored from session)"**
- ✅ Auto-sync triggered if online (or waits for reconnection)

**Sync Prioritization:**
- High priority: Restore queued operations immediately
- Schedule auto-sync within 5 seconds of successful login

**Technical Notes:**
- Session timeout (Story 5.27) saves pending queue to IndexedDB before timeout
- On re-login: IndexedDB queue checked and restored (see AC4 persistence)
- Connection restored: Trigger immediate sync of restored queue

---

### AC 7: Network Detection with Fallback

**Given** Scanner PWA with network status indicator
**And** Primary network detection mechanism unreliable (e.g., `navigator.onLine` false positive)

**When** monitoring network status
**Then** implement robust detection:
- ✅ Primary: `navigator.onLine` event listener
- ✅ Fallback: Periodic ping to server (every 5 seconds)
- ✅ Ping endpoint: `GET /api/health` (lightweight, no auth required)
- ✅ If ping fails: Assume offline, continue queueing
- ✅ If ping succeeds: Trigger sync of queued operations
- ✅ UI reflects actual network state (not just `navigator.onLine`)

**Ping Logic:**
```
Every 5 seconds:
  if navigator.onLine:
    ping /api/health
    - Success (200): Network OK, sync if queued operations exist
    - Failure: Network down, mark as offline
  else:
    Wait for navigator.onLine event + fallback ping
```

**Technical Notes:**
- Ping includes: device_id, timestamp (no auth required)
- Server responds immediately (no processing)
- Timeout: 3 seconds (fallback to offline if no response)

---

### AC 8: Queue Size Warning in Settings

**Given** Admin navigates to /settings/scanner
**Then** verify configurable queue settings:
- ✅ Max queue size (default: 100, range: 50-500)
- ✅ Warning threshold % (default: 80%, range: 50-90%)
- ✅ Auto-sync on reconnect (default: enabled, toggle)
- ✅ Sync batch size (default: 10, range: 5-50)
- ✅ Failed queue retention days (default: 7, range: 1-30)

**When** Admin changes max queue size to 200
**Then** verify:
- ✅ Scanner now allows 200 operations before blocking
- ✅ Warning threshold updates: 80% of 200 = 160 operations

**Technical Notes:**
- Settings stored in `warehouse_settings` table
- Settings synced to scanner on load

---

### AC 9: E2E Test - 100 Offline Operations + Sync

**Test Scenario: Full Queue Capacity**

**Given** Scanner PWA offline
**When** Operator performs 100 consecutive operations:
1. Receive 50 LPs (from PO)
2. Consume 30 LPs (for WO)
3. Move 15 LPs (location change)
4. Split 5 LPs

**Then** verify offline queue:
- ✅ All 100 operations stored in IndexedDB
- ✅ UI shows: **"⚠️ Queue full (100/100). Sync required."**
- ❌ 101st operation blocked: **"Offline queue full. Please reconnect."**

**When** network reconnects
**Then** verify sync:
- ✅ Auto-sync starts within 2 seconds
- ✅ UI shows: **"⏳ Syncing 100 operations..."**
- ✅ Progress updates: 10/100, 20/100, ..., 100/100
- ✅ All 100 operations synced successfully within 30 seconds
- ✅ Database verification:
  - 50 GRNs created with 50 LPs (receive operations)
  - 30 wo_consumption records created (consume operations)
  - 15 lp_movements records created (move operations)
  - 5 LP split records + genealogy (split operations)
- ✅ Queue cleared: UI shows **"✅ All operations synced"**
- ✅ IndexedDB offline queue empty

**Performance Target:**
- ✅ 100 operations sync in <30 seconds (batches of 10 = 10 API calls)
- ✅ No data loss (100% success rate for valid operations)

**Technical Notes:**
- E2E test file: `tests/e2e/integration/scanner-offline-queue.spec.ts`
- Mock network offline: `page.context().setOffline(true)`
- Mock network online: `page.context().setOffline(false)`
