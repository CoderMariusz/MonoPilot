# Story 6.8: Quality Hold Release Approval

## Goal
Require approval for releasing holds to ensure proper authorization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- **If approval ENABLED** (require_hold_release_approval = true):
  - QC user clicks "Release" → hold status → 'pending_release'
  - Manager/Admin sees pending releases in dashboard
  - Manager approves → hold status → 'released', LP.qa_status updated
  - Manager rejects → hold status → 'open' (back to investigation)
- **If approval DISABLED** (require_hold_release_approval = false):
  - QC user clicks "Release" → immediate release (no approval needed)
  - hold status → 'released', LP.qa_status updated
- LP.qa_status after release: user chooses 'passed' (approved) or 'pending' (re-test needed)
- Approval/release recorded with timestamp and user
