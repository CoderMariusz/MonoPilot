# 02.8 - Routing Operations (Steps) Management

**State:** ready
**Type:** full-stack
**Estimate:** L (complex - many operation fields, reordering, parallel operations)
**Primary PRD:** `docs/1-BASELINE/product/modules/technical.md` (FR-2.41, FR-2.43, FR-2.44, FR-2.45, FR-2.48)
**UX Wireframes:** TEC-008a (Routing Detail), TEC-008 (Routing Modal - for context)

## Goal

Implement complete routing operations (production steps) management including CRUD operations, sequence numbering with parallel operation support, setup/run/cleanup times, work center assignment, operation instructions, and file attachments. This is the core production workflow definition that determines how products are manufactured.

## Scope

**In scope**
- GET /api/technical/routings/:id/operations (list all operations for a routing)
- POST /api/technical/routings/:id/operations (add operation to routing)
- PUT /api/technical/routings/:id/operations/:opId (update operation)
- DELETE /api/technical/routings/:id/operations/:opId (remove operation)
- PATCH /api/technical/routings/:id/operations/:opId/reorder (move up/down)
- **POST /api/technical/routings/:id/operations/:opId/attachments (upload attachment - FR-2.45)**
- **DELETE /api/technical/routings/:id/operations/:opId/attachments/:attachId (remove attachment - FR-2.45)**
- Operations table with inline actions (edit, delete, reorder arrows)
- Add/Edit operation modal with all fields
- Operation fields: sequence, name, description, machine_id, setup_time, duration, cleanup_time, labor_cost_per_hour, instructions
- **Operation attachments for work instructions (PDFs, images, documents - FR-2.45)**
- Sequence management with parallel operations support (FR-2.48)
- Auto-suggest next sequence number
- Up/Down reordering with sequence swapping
- Work center (machine) dropdown from machines table
- Cost & duration summary panel with expandable breakdown
- Related BOMs section showing routing usage

**Out of scope**
- Routing header CRUD (covered in 02.7)
- BOM-routing assignment (covered in 02.4)
- Routing cost calculation service (separate story)
- Operation quality checkpoints (moved to Epic 6 - Quality Module)
- Drag-and-drop reordering (deferred - using arrows instead)
- Gantt chart visualization (Phase 2 Complex - future)
- Resource conflict detection (Phase 2 Complex - future)

## Dependencies
- **02.7** - Routings CRUD (required for routing header exists)
- **Epic 01 (Settings)** - Machines/Work Centers master data (machines table for machine_id dropdown)
- **Migration 044** - Added routing_operations.cleanup_time and instructions fields
- **Migration 050** - Removed unique sequence constraint (allows parallel operations)

## Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then)

### Operations List (TEC-008a)
- GIVEN user navigates to routing detail `/technical/routings/:id`, WHEN operations section loads, THEN operations display in sequence order within 500ms for up to 50 operations.
- GIVEN routing has 10 operations, WHEN operations table renders, THEN each row shows: sequence, name, machine name, duration (min), setup time (min), yield%, labor cost/hr, and action buttons.
- GIVEN operations table displayed, WHEN sequence numbers contain duplicates (parallel ops), THEN "(Parallel)" indicator appends to operation name.
- GIVEN routing has operations, WHEN summary panel renders, THEN displays: total operations count, total duration (formatted as "Xh Ym"), total setup time, total cleanup time, total labor cost, average yield.
- GIVEN user clicks "[i View Breakdown]", WHEN panel expands, THEN per-operation breakdown displays with individual times and costs.

### Add Operation
- GIVEN user clicks "[+ Add Operation]", WHEN modal opens, THEN form displays: sequence (auto-filled), name, description, machine dropdown, duration, setup_time, cleanup_time, yield%, instructions textarea, labor_cost_per_hour.
- GIVEN routing has operations with sequences 1, 2, 3, WHEN add modal opens, THEN sequence field auto-fills with "4" (max + 1).
- GIVEN user enters sequence "2" which already exists, WHEN typing completes, THEN info message shows "[i] Sequence 2 is already used by 'Proofing'. This operation will run in parallel." (NOT blocking error).
- GIVEN valid operation data (sequence=4, name="Cooling", duration=20), WHEN "Add Operation" clicked, THEN operation created, modal closes, table refreshes, toast shows success.
- GIVEN user enters name with fewer than 3 characters, WHEN save attempted, THEN error "Name must be at least 3 characters" displays inline.

### Edit Operation
- GIVEN user clicks [Edit] on existing operation, WHEN modal opens, THEN form pre-populates with current operation data including instructions.
- GIVEN user changes duration from 30 to 45, WHEN save completes, THEN updated duration displays immediately in operations table and summary recalculates.
- GIVEN user edits instructions text to 2001 characters, WHEN save attempted, THEN error "Instructions must be less than 2000 characters" displays.
- GIVEN user assigns machine from "None" to "Mixer-01", WHEN save completes, THEN machine column shows "Mixer-01".

### Delete Operation
- GIVEN user clicks [Del] on operation, WHEN confirmation dialog shows, THEN message reads "Delete operation 'Mixing'? This action cannot be undone."
- GIVEN user confirms delete, WHEN deletion completes, THEN operation removed from table within 500ms and summary recalculates.
- GIVEN user cancels delete, WHEN dialog dismissed, THEN operation remains unchanged.

### Reorder Operations (Up/Down)
- GIVEN operation at sequence 2, WHEN user clicks [^] (move up), THEN operation swaps sequence with operation at sequence 1.
- GIVEN operation at sequence 1 (first), WHEN [^] button rendered, THEN button is disabled.
- GIVEN operation at max sequence (last), WHEN [v] button rendered, THEN button is disabled.

### Database

#### routing_operations table (existing, enhanced by migrations 044, 050)
```sql
routing_operations:
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  routing_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES routings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sequence INTEGER NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  machine_id UUID REFERENCES machines(id),

// File size limit
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB

// Storage path pattern: {org_id}/{routing_id}/{operation_id}/{file_name}
function getStoragePath(orgId: string, routingId: string, operationId: string, fileName: string): string {
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const sanitizedName = fileName.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/g, '_');

### Validation (Zod)

```typescript
const operationFormSchema = z.object({
  sequence: z.number()
    .int("Sequence must be an integer")
    .min(1, "Sequence must be at least 1"),
  name: z.string()
    .min(3, "Name must be at least 3 characters")
    .max(100, "Name must be less than 100 characters"),
  description: z.string()
    .max(500, "Description must be less than 500 characters")
    .nullable()
    .optional(),
  machine_id: z.string().uuid().nullable().optional(),
  setup_time: z.number()
    .int("Setup time must be an integer")
    .min(0, "Setup time cannot be negative")
    .default(0),
  duration: z.number()
    .int("Duration must be an integer")
    .min(1, "Duration must be at least 1 minute"),
  cleanup_time: z.number()
    .int("Cleanup time must be an integer")
    .min(0, "Cleanup time cannot be negative")
    .default(0),
  labor_cost_per_hour: z.number()
    .min(0, "Labor cost cannot be negative")
    .default(0),
  instructions: z.string()
    .max(2000, "Instructions must be less than 2000 characters")
    .nullable()
    .optional(),
});

// FR-2.45: Attachment validation
const ALLOWED_TYPES = ['application/pdf', 'image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document'];

const attachmentSchema = z.object({
  file: z.instanceof(File)
    .refine(file => file.size <= 10 * 1024 * 1024, "File size must be less than 10MB")
    .refine(file => ALLOWED_TYPES.includes(file.type), "File type not allowed (PDF, PNG, JPG, DOCX only)"),
});
```

### Key Business Rules

1. **Sequence numbering**: Sequences can be duplicated (parallel operations - FR-2.48)
2. **Parallel operations**: Same sequence = run simultaneously
3. **Duration calculation**: For parallel ops, use MAX duration per sequence group
4. **Cost calculation**: Sum ALL operation costs (parallel ops both incur cost)
5. **Total operation time**: setup_time + duration + cleanup_time
6. **Auto-sequence**: New operations default to max(sequences) + 1
7. **Reorder logic**: Swap sequences between adjacent operations
8. **Machine optional**: Operations can run without assigned machine/work center
9. **Instructions limit**: Max 2000 characters for operator instructions
10. **Attachments limit**: Max 5 files per operation, 10MB each (FR-2.45)
11. **Attachment types**: PDF, PNG, JPG, DOCX only (FR-2.45)
12. **Attachment cleanup**: Delete from storage when operation deleted (FR-2.45)

### Parallel Operations Detection

```typescript
// Detect and mark parallel operations
const detectParallelOperations = (operations: RoutingOperation[]) => {
  const sequenceCounts = operations.reduce((acc, op) => {
    acc[op.sequence] = (acc[op.sequence] || 0) + 1;
    return acc;
  }, {} as Record<number, number>);

  return operations.map(op => ({
    ...op,
    isParallel: sequenceCounts[op.sequence] > 1,
    displayName: sequenceCounts[op.sequence] > 1
      ? `${op.name} (Parallel)`
      : op.name
  }));
};
```

### Duration Calculation with Parallel Ops

```typescript
const calculateTotalDuration = (operations: RoutingOperation[]) => {
  // Group by sequence
  const grouped = operations.reduce((acc, op) => {
    if (!acc[op.sequence]) acc[op.sequence] = [];
    acc[op.sequence].push(op);
    return acc;
  }, {} as Record<number, RoutingOperation[]>);

  // For each sequence group, take MAX total time
  return Object.values(grouped).reduce((total, group) => {
    const maxTime = Math.max(...group.map(op =>
      op.setup_time + op.duration + op.cleanup_time
    ));
    return total + maxTime;
  }, 0);
};
```

### Attachment Upload Component (FR-2.45)

```tsx
// components/technical/routings/AttachmentUpload.tsx
interface AttachmentUploadProps {
  operationId: string;
  routingId: string;
  currentCount: number;
  maxCount: number;
  onUploadComplete: (attachment: OperationAttachment) => void;
}

// Drag-and-drop zone with file validation
<div className="border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 rounded-lg p-6">
  <input
    type="file"
    accept=".pdf,.png,.jpg,.jpeg,.docx"
    onChange={handleFileSelect}
    disabled={currentCount >= maxCount}
  />
  <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
    Drop files or click to upload (PDF, PNG, JPG, DOCX - max 10MB)
  </p>
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-400">
    {currentCount}/{maxCount} attachments
  </p>
</div>
```
