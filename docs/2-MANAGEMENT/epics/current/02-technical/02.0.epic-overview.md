# Epic 02 - Technical Module (Products, BOMs, Routings)

**Epic ID:** 02
**Module:** Technical
**Status:** READY (Stories Defined)
**Type:** Core Module (Foundation for Production)
**Primary References:**
- PRD: `docs/1-BASELINE/product/modules/technical.md`
- Architecture: `docs/1-BASELINE/architecture/modules/technical.md`
- UX Wireframes: `docs/3-ARCHITECTURE/ux/wireframes/TEC-001` to `TEC-017`

---

## Goal

Deliver the **Technical Module** providing complete product lifecycle management from formulation to production routing. This module establishes:
- Product master data with versioning and allergen tracking
- Bill of Materials (BOM) with date validity, conditional items, and alternatives
- Routing operations with cost calculation (ADR-009)
- Forward/backward traceability and recall simulation
- Recipe costing, nutrition calculation, and shelf life management

This epic provides the **product and recipe foundation** required by Planning, Production, and Warehouse modules.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

**Out of Scope for Epic 02:**
- Product image upload (FR-2.9) - Phase 2E-1
- Product barcode generation (FR-2.11) - Future
- Product categories and tags (FR-2.12) - Future
- Routing templates (FR-2.47) - Future
- Ingredient origin tracking (FR-2.66) - Future
- Cross-contamination tracking (FR-2.67) - Future
- Cost scenario modeling (FR-2.76) - Future
- AI-powered BOM optimization - Future
- GraphQL API for traceability - Future

These features are planned for later phases or future releases.

---

## External Dependencies (Cross-Epic)

### Required from Epic 01 (Settings Demo MVP Subset)

Epic 02 requires ONLY the foundation from Epic 01 stories (01.1) - no full Settings Phase 1B/2/3 needed.

| Dependency | Story | What It Provides | Status |
|------------|-------|------------------|--------|
| `organizations` table | 01.1 | Multi-tenancy foundation, org_id FK for all tables | **REQUIRED** |
| `users` table | 01.1 | Audit fields (created_by, updated_by) | **REQUIRED** |
| `roles` table seeded | 01.1 | RBAC enforcement (Production Manager, Admin) | **REQUIRED** |
| Base RLS policies | 01.1 | org_id isolation, auth.uid() resolution | **REQUIRED** |
| `getOrgContext()` helper | 01.1 | Utility function for RLS queries | **REQUIRED** |

**Prerequisite**: Complete Story 01.1 (Org Context + Base RLS) before starting Epic 02.

---

### Created Within Epic 02 (Self-Sufficient)

The following master data is created as part of Epic 02 stories (not deferred to Settings):

| Table | Story | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| `allergens` | **02.3** | Static EU 14 regulatory data - seeded via migration, no Settings UI needed initially |

**Why embedded?** Allergens are required for Product module (Epic 02) but are static reference data. Creating them in 02.3 unblocks Epic 02 without waiting for full Settings master data UI (Epic 01 Phase 2).

---

### Deferred Dependencies (Optional/Future)

The following dependencies are OPTIONAL (nullable FKs) or deferred to later epics:

| Dependency | Used By | Status | Notes |
|------------|---------|--------|-------|
| `machines` | 02.8 (Routing Operations) | **OPTIONAL** | `machine_id` is NULLABLE - operations work without machines. Dropdown shows empty state if no machines exist. |
| `production_lines` | 02.5 (BOM Items) | **OPTIONAL** | `line_ids` is NULLABLE array - BOMs work without line assignment (NULL = all lines). |
| `locations` | N/A | **NOT USED** | No Epic 02 stories reference locations table. |
| `license_plates` | 02.10b (Trace Queries) | **DEFERRED** | Story 02.10a implements config only. Trace queries split to 02.10b (after Epic 05). |

---

### Dependency Summary

**Epic 02 CAN proceed immediately once Story 01.1 is complete.**

```
Epic 01.1 (Org Context + RLS)
    |
Epic 02.1-02.15 (ALL stories except 02.10b)
    |
Epic 02.10b (Deferred to Epic 05)
```

**No full Settings Phase 1B/2/3 required** - Epic 01 demo subset (01.1-01.7) is sufficient.

---

## Epic 02 Scope Clarification

### In Scope (15 stories ready for implementation)
- 02.1 to 02.9: Product CRUD, BOMs, Routings, Costs
- 02.10a: Traceability Configuration (GS1, product config)
- 02.11 to 02.15: Shelf Life, Technical Dashboard, Nutrition, BOM Advanced, Cost History

### Deferred to Later Phases
- 02.10b: Traceability Queries (after Epic 05 - Warehouse/LP)

### Created in Epic 02 (not waiting for Settings)
- Allergens table + EU 14 seed (02.3 migration)

### External Prerequisites
- Epic 01.1 ONLY (Org Context + Base RLS)

## Definition of Done (Epic 02)

- [ ] Products: CRUD with versioning, types, allergens
- [ ] Allergens: Table created with EU 14 seed data
- [ ] BOMs: CRUD with items, date validity, alternatives, clone
- [ ] Routings: CRUD with operations, cost configuration
- [ ] Traceability Config: GS1 encoding, lot format configuration
- [ ] Shelf Life: Calculation from ingredients, manual override
- [ ] Dashboard: Stats, allergen matrix, version timeline
- [ ] Costing: BOM cost rollup with routing costs
- [ ] Nutrition: Calculation from ingredients, FDA label
- [ ] All RLS policies enforced (org_id isolation)
- [ ] All stories have unit tests (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E smoke tests for critical flows
- [ ] Performance: Product list <1s, BOM explosion <2s

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| BOM date overlap bugs | High | Database trigger enforcement + integration tests |
| Cost calculation errors | High | Comprehensive unit tests for costing-service.ts |
| Traceability performance | Medium | Indexed queries, materialized genealogy paths |
| RLS policy gaps | High | Security review, multi-tenant integration tests |
| Allergen inheritance bugs | Medium | Test allergen rollup on BOM changes |
| Routing cost versioning | Medium | Snapshot captured at WO creation per ADR-002 |
| Multi-level BOM explosion | Medium | Depth limit (10 levels), caching |
| Machine dependency | Low | NULLABLE FK, graceful empty state in UI |

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Demo: Create product, BOM, routing, calculate cost
- [ ] BOM date validity enforced (no overlaps)
- [ ] Allergen inheritance automatic from BOM items
- [ ] Traceability config saved per product (GS1 settings)
- [ ] Cost calculation <500ms for 5-level BOM
- [ ] 80% of products have active BOMs
- [ ] 70% of products have routings assigned
