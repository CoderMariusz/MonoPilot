# 10.19 - TPM & Benchmarking

**Priority**: P1
**Story Points**: M (Medium)
**Type**: fullstack
**Phase**: 3
**Model**: OPUS

**State:** ready
**Estimate:** M (3-4 days)
**Primary PRD:** `docs/1-BASELINE/product/modules/oee.md` (FR-OEE-026, OEE-027)

---

## Goal

Integrate TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) schedule with OEE tracking and provide OEE benchmarking against industry standards, peer organizations, and internal best-in-class targets.

---

## User Story

As a **Plant Manager**, I want to **compare our OEE against industry benchmarks and track our improvement over time** so that **I can set realistic targets and demonstrate continuous improvement**.

---

## Scope

**TPM Integration**
- Link maintenance schedule to machine availability
- Track planned vs unplanned maintenance
- Maintenance impact on OEE
- Preventive maintenance effectiveness score

**OEE Benchmarking**
- Industry benchmark library (Food & Beverage: 85% world-class, 60-75% typical)
- Internal benchmarking (best line, best shift, best day)
- Peer comparison (anonymized, opt-in)
- Benchmark gap analysis
- Improvement tracking vs baseline

---

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Compare to industry benchmark
  Given organization OEE = 72%
  And industry benchmark = 75% (typical), 85% (world-class)
  When viewing benchmark report
  Then shows:
    | Metric | Our OEE | Industry Typical | World-Class |
    | OEE | 72% | 75% | 85% |
    | Gap to Typical | -3% | - | - |
    | Gap to World-Class | -13% | - | - |
  And recommendations: "Improve availability to reach typical (currently 78%, target 85%)"

Scenario: Internal best-in-class
  Given 3 production lines:
    | Line | OEE |
    | Line 1 | 85% |
    | Line 2 | 72% |
    | Line 3 | 68% |
  When viewing internal benchmark
  Then Line 1 = best-in-class (85%)
  And Line 2 gap = -13%
  And Line 3 gap = -17%
  And message: "Line 2 and 3 have potential to match Line 1 performance"

Scenario: Improvement tracking
  Given baseline OEE (Jan 2025) = 68%
  And current OEE (Dec 2025) = 78%
  When viewing improvement report
  Then improvement = +10 percentage points (+14.7%)
  And trend chart shows monthly progression
  And milestones highlighted (crossed 70%, 75%)
