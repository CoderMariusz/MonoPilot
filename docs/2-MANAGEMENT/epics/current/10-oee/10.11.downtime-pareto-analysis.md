**Priority**: P0
**Story Points**: M (Medium)
**Type**: frontend
**Phase**: 2
**Model**: OPUS

**State:** ready
**Estimate:** M (2-3 days)
**Primary PRD:** `docs/1-BASELINE/product/modules/oee.md` (FR-OEE-017)

## Goal

Pareto chart visualization for downtime reasons showing frequency, duration, and cumulative percentage to identify the "vital few" root causes (80/20 rule).

---

## User Story

As a **Continuous Improvement Manager**, I want to **see a Pareto chart of downtime reasons** so that **I can focus improvement efforts on the top contributors (80/20 rule)**.

---

## Scope

- Pareto chart: Bars (downtime duration) + Line (cumulative %)
- Top 10 downtime reasons
- Time period selection
- Drill-down to specific reason details
- GET /api/oee/downtime/analysis
- Pareto chart component

---

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Scenario: Pareto chart for downtime
  Given downtime events last week:
    | Reason | Duration |
    | Machine Jams | 180 min (37%) |
    | Setup | 145 min (30%) |
    | Cleaning | 85 min (18%) |
    | Other | 75 min (15%) |
  When viewing Pareto chart
  Then bars show duration descending
  And line shows cumulative % (37%, 67%, 85%, 100%)
  And 80% line highlighted
  And top 2 reasons account for 67% of downtime

Scenario: Click reason to drill down
  Given Pareto chart displayed
  When user clicks "Machine Jams" bar
  Then navigate to downtime events filtered by that reason
  And show all jam events in detail
```
