# Epic 04 - Production Module (WO Execution, Consumption, Outputs, OEE)

**Epic ID:** 04
**Module:** Production
**Status:** STORIES TO BE CREATED
**Type:** Core Module (Shop Floor Execution)
**Primary References:**
- PRD: `docs/1-BASELINE/product/modules/production.md`
- Architecture: `docs/1-BASELINE/architecture/modules/production.md`
- Story Brief: `docs/2-MANAGEMENT/epics/current/04-production/04.0.story-creation-brief.md`

## Goal

Deliver the **Production Module** enabling complete shop floor execution of Work Orders. This module provides:

- **WO Execution** - Start, pause, resume, complete Work Orders
- **Material Consumption** - LP-based consumption with reservations and validation
- **Output Registration** - Create finished goods LPs with genealogy
- **Operations Tracking** - Sequence control, yield capture, duration tracking
- **Production Dashboard** - Real-time KPIs, active WOs, alerts
- **Scanner Workflows** - Mobile-first consumption and output registration
- **OEE Tracking** - Availability, Performance, Quality metrics (Phase 2)
- **Downtime Management** - Categorized downtime for OEE calculation (Phase 2)

This epic is the **shop floor backbone** connecting Planning (Epic 03) to Warehouse (Epic 05) through LP-based transactions.

## CRITICAL: License Plate (LP) Dependency

**Epic 04 Production has a HARD dependency on Epic 05 Warehouse (License Plates).**

| Production Feature | LP Dependency | Impact |
|--------------------|---------------|--------|
| Material Consumption | Consumes from LPs | Cannot consume without LP table |
| Output Registration | Creates new LPs | Cannot register output without LP table |
| Reservations | Reserves specific LPs | Cannot reserve without LP table |
| Genealogy | Links consumed LPs to output LPs | Requires lp_genealogy table |

**Resolution Options:**

### Option A: Sequential (Epic 05 First) - RECOMMENDED
```
Epic 03 WO CRUD --> Epic 05 LPs + Genealogy --> Epic 04 Production
```
- **Pros:** Clean dependency, no mock implementations
- **Cons:** Production must wait for Warehouse

### Option B: Parallel with Phase Split
```
Epic 03 WO CRUD --> Epic 04a MVP (no LP) --> Epic 05 LPs --> Epic 04b Full
```
- Epic 04a: Dashboard, Settings, WO lifecycle (start/pause/complete) WITHOUT consumption/output
- Epic 04b: Consumption, Output, Reservations (requires Epic 05)

### Option C: Epic 04 Creates LP Tables (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- Production creates license_plates, lp_genealogy tables
- Epic 05 extends rather than creates
- **Risk:** Ownership confusion, migration conflicts

**DECISION:** Recommend **Option B** - Parallel with phase split to allow progress while respecting LP dependency.

## Delivery Order Recommendation

### Sprint 1 (Epic 04a MVP Core) - Days 1-7

After Epic 03.10-03.12 complete:

| Day | Story | Complexity | Notes |
|-----|-------|------------|-------|
| 1-2 | 04.5 Production Settings | M | Configure module first |
| 2-3 | 04.1 Production Dashboard | M | KPIs, alerts |
| 3-4 | 04.2a WO Start | M | Begin execution |
| 4-5 | 04.2b WO Pause/Resume | S | Interruptions |
| 5-6 | 04.3 Operation Start/Complete | M | Step tracking |
| 6-7 | 04.2c WO Complete | M | Close out |
| 7 | 04.4 Yield Tracking | S | Metrics |

**Deliverable:** WO lifecycle without consumption/output (still useful for planning visibility)

### Sprint 2 (Epic 04b Full Production) - Days 8-24

After Epic 05 LP tables complete:

| Day | Story | Complexity | Notes |
|-----|-------|------------|-------|
| 8-10 | 04.6a Consumption Desktop | L | Core consumption |
| 10-12 | 04.7a Output Desktop | L | Core output |
| 12-13 | 04.6c 1:1 Consumption | S | Allergen control |
| 13-15 | 04.6b Consumption Scanner | L | Mobile workflow |
| 15-17 | 04.7b Output Scanner | L | Mobile workflow |
| 17-18 | 04.6d Consumption Correction | M | Reversal |
| 18-19 | 04.6e Over-Consumption Control | M | Approval |
| 19-20 | 04.7c By-Product Registration | M | Secondary outputs |
| 20-21 | 04.7d Multiple Outputs | S | Partial completion |
| 21-24 | 04.8 Material Reservations | L | LP allocation |

**Deliverable:** Full production execution with LP-based consumption and output

### Sprint 3 (Phase 2 OEE) - Days 25-40

| Day | Story | Complexity | Notes |
|-----|-------|------------|-------|
| 25-27 | 04.9d Shift Management | M | Foundation for OEE |
| 27-29 | 04.9b Downtime Tracking | M | Availability factor |
| 29-32 | 04.9a OEE Calculation | L | Core OEE |
| 32-34 | 04.9c Machine Integration | M | Manual counters |
| 34-40 | 04.10a-g Analytics Reports | S each | 7 reports |

**Deliverable:** OEE tracking and production analytics

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **LP dependency blocks Phase 1** | High | Certain | Phase split (04a/04b), defer consumption/output to Epic 05+ |
| Scanner UX issues | Medium | Medium | Large touch targets (48px+), audio feedback, user testing |
| OEE calculation errors | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive unit tests, reference OEE examples |
| Genealogy complexity | High | Medium | Clear data model, integration tests |
| Over-consumption approval delays | Low | Medium | Async workflow, notifications |
| Dashboard performance | Medium | Low | Caching (30s TTL), efficient queries |
| Concurrent WO edits | Medium | Low | Optimistic locking, RLS |

---

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Demo: Start WO -> Consume materials -> Register output -> Complete WO
- [ ] Scanner: Full workflow under 30 seconds
- [ ] Genealogy: Trace output LP back to consumed materials
- [ ] OEE: Accurate calculation matching formula
- [ ] Dashboard: Updates within 30 seconds
- [ ] Performance: <1s page loads, <2s report generation
