# Production Module Delta Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Production Module enhancements for the MonoPilot MES system. The enhancements include advanced work order management, yield tracking, consumption monitoring, traceability, and scanner integration.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Work Order Management
- **Enhanced Work Orders**: Added KPI scope (PR/FG), actual start/end times, yield tracking
- **BOM Snapshots**: Automatic BOM versioning on work order creation
- **Stage Status**: Real-time operation staging with color-coded status
- **Close Work Orders**: Proper work order closure with audit trail

### 2. Yield Tracking
- **PR Yield**: Primary product yield tracking with consumption metrics
- **FG Yield**: Finished goods yield with waste tracking
- **KPI Calculations**: Automated yield percentage, plan accuracy, on-time completion
- **Time Buckets**: Day/Week/Month reporting periods

### 3. Consumption Monitoring
- **Material Variance**: Track actual vs planned consumption
- **BOM Compliance**: Validate material usage against BOM standards
- **Variance Analysis**: Color-coded variance indicators (green/amber/red)
- **Cross-WO Tracking**: Monitor material usage across work orders

### 4. Traceability System
- **Forward Trace**: From raw materials to finished goods
- **Backward Trace**: From finished goods to raw materials
- **LP Compositions**: Track which LPs created which outputs
- **Pallet Tracking**: Monitor pallet contents and LP relationships

### 5. Scanner Integration
- **Stage Board**: Real-time operation status with color coding
- **Process Terminal**: Staging, weight recording, operation completion
- **Pack Terminal**: Pallet creation and LP composition tracking
- **QA Override**: Supervisor PIN-based QA status changes

## Business Rules

### 1. Sequential Routing
- Operations must be completed in sequence
- Cannot start operation N+1 until operation N is complete
- Validates operation has IN and OUT weights recorded

### 2. Hard 1:1 Component Rule
- One-to-one components require exactly one input LP → one output LP
- No partial consumption allowed for 1:1 components
- Enforced during weight recording and operation completion

### 3. Cross-WO PR Intake
- Validates exact product matching across work orders
- Ensures stage suffix matches expected stage
- No substitutions allowed (strict matching)

### 4. Reservation-Safe Operations
- Prevents operations exceeding available quantities
- Calculates available quantity as: `lp.quantity - SUM(open reservations)`
- Shows warnings when attempting to use reserved quantities

### 5. QA Gate Enforcement
- Blocks operations with failed QA status
- Allows supervisor override with PIN and reason
- Audits all QA overrides in metadata

## Database Schema Changes

1. **wo_materials**: BOM snapshots for work orders
2. **lp_reservations**: License plate reservations
3. **lp_compositions**: LP composition tracking
4. **pallets**: Pallet management
5. **pallet_items**: Pallet contents

### Enhanced Tables
1. **work_orders**: Added KPI scope, actual times, yield tracking
2. **license_plates**: Enhanced with parent relationships, stage suffixes
3. **stock_moves**: Added move types, status, work order references
4. **wo_operations**: Added weight tracking, loss calculations

### Views and Functions
1. **vw_yield_pr_daily/weekly/monthly**: PR yield reporting
2. **vw_yield_fg_daily/weekly/monthly**: FG yield reporting
3. **vw_consume**: Consumption tracking
4. **vw_trace_forward/backward**: Enhanced traceability
5. **get_available_quantity**: Reservation calculations

## KPI Definitions

### PR Yield%
```
PR Yield% = (Actual Output / Planned Output) × 100
```

### FG Yield%
```
FG Yield% = (Actual Output / Planned Output) × 100
```

### PR Consumption/kg
```
PR Consumption/kg = Total Material Consumed / Total Output Produced
```

### Plan Accuracy
```
Plan Accuracy = (Actual Output / Planned Output) × 100
```

### On-Time WO%
```
On-Time WO% = (Completed On-Time WOs / Total WOs) × 100
```

### Material Variance
```
Material Variance = (Actual Consumed - BOM Standard) / BOM Standard × 100
```
