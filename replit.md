## Technology Stack

### Backend
- PHP 8.4
- Laravel 12
- Filament v4
- Laravel Sanctum (authentication)
- Spatie Laravel Permission (RBAC)
- Spatie Laravel Activity Log (audit trail)
- Barryvdh Laravel DomPDF (label printing)
- Maatwebsite Excel (exports)

### Frontend
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (10px base font size)
- Lucide React (icons)
- SWR (data fetching)
- Zod (validation)

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL 17
- pnpm workspaces
- Node.js 20

## Key Features (Planned)

### Planning Module
- Work Orders (WO) management with material availability checking
- Purchase Orders (PO) tracking
- Transfer Orders (TO) management
- MRP calculations

### Production Module
- Overview dashboard (machine-by-WO)
- Reporting (Yield Reports, Consume Reports)
- Scanner module (Process & Pack terminals)

### Warehouse Module
- Goods Receipt (GRN) with auto LP generation
- Stock movements and transfers
- LP operations (Split, Amend, QA Status)
- Location-based inventory

### Technical Module
- BOM editor with Process Recipes
- Item type management (Meat, Dry Goods, Finish Good, Process)
- ECN workflow
- Machine/Calibration management

### Admin Panel
- User management
- Login activity tracking
- Session monitoring
- System-wide settings

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application
```bash
# Frontend (already running on port 5000)
cd apps/frontend && pnpm dev

# Backend (Laravel)
cd apps/backend && php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

### Database Migrations
```bash
cd apps/backend && php artisan migrate
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication
- Laravel Sanctum with session-based auth
- Same domain for frontend and backend
- 7 roles: Operator, Planner, Technical, Purchasing, Warehouse, QC, Admin

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Filament-like styling (neutral/slate color scheme)
- Base font size: 10px (1rem = 10px)
- Dark left sidebar
- Topbar with search and user avatar
- All text in English
- Lucide icons throughout

### 13-Step Workflow
1. Add Item to system
2. Create Process Recipe (multiple RM â†’ one PR)
3. Create Finish Product BOM (multiple items â†’ one FG)
4. Create PO or TO for items
5. Receive items in warehouse (GRN)
6. Move items between locations
7. Create Work Order (Planning)
8. Start Work Order (Production/Scanner)
9. Consume Stock (reserve items to WO)
10. Create Item from WO (against BOM)
11. Move items to Warehouse (putaway)
12. Close Work Order (consume, calculate yields)
13. Send Items Out (shipping/dispatch)

## Security Notes
- `.env` files are gitignored and never committed
- `.env.example` uses environment variable placeholders (${PGHOST}, ${PGPORT}, etc.)
- Database credentials are managed through Replit secrets
- All sensitive configuration uses environment variables

## Recent Changes
