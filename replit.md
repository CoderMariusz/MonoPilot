## Current Status (October 2025 - Complete Frontend Rebuild)

### Phase 1 - Frontend Complete âœ…
All modules built with static data and client-side state management:

- âœ… **Planning Module** - Work Orders, Purchase Orders, Transfer Orders (full CRUD)
- âœ… **Production Module** - Work Orders view, Yield Report, Consume Report
- âœ… **Technical Module** - BOM & Items Catalog (Meat, Dry Goods, Process, Finished Goods)
- âœ… **Warehouse Module** - GRN, Stock Move, LP Operations (full CRUD)
- âœ… **Scanner Module** - Process & Pack terminals (mobile-optimized for handheld devices)
- âœ… **Admin Module** - User Management, Sessions, Settings
- âœ… Client-side state management (lib/clientState.ts) with reactive hooks
- âœ… Comprehensive mock data for all modules
- âœ… Filament-like UI design (neutral/slate colors, 10px base font)

### Phase 2 - Backend Integration (Next Steps)
- ðŸ”„ Set up Prisma ORM with complete schema
- ðŸ”„ Configure Supabase or Replit PostgreSQL
- ðŸ”„ Implement authentication (Replit Auth preferred)
- ðŸ”„ Create Next.js API routes for all modules
- ðŸ”„ Connect frontend to backend (replace clientState with API calls)
- ðŸ”„ Implement RBAC (7 roles: Operator, Planner, Technical, Purchasing, Warehouse, QC, Admin)

## Technology Stack

### Frontend (Current)
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (10px base font size, 12px on mobile)
- Lucide React (icons)
- Client-side state management with hooks
- Toast notifications

### Backend (To Be Implemented)
- Prisma ORM
- Next.js API routes
- PostgreSQL (Supabase or Replit)
- Authentication (Replit Auth or NextAuth)
- RBAC with 7 roles

### Infrastructure
- Node.js 20
- pnpm workspaces
- Single Next.js application (port 5000)

## Key Features (Planned)

### Planning Module
- Work Orders (WO) management with material availability checking
- Purchase Orders (PO) tracking
- Transfer Orders (TO) management
- MRP calculations

### Production Module
- Overview dashboard (machine-by-WO)
- Reporting (Yield Reports, Consume Reports)
- Scanner module (Process & Pack terminals)

### Warehouse Module
- Goods Receipt (GRN) with auto LP generation
- Stock movements and transfers
- LP operations (Split, Amend, QA Status)
- Location-based inventory

### Technical Module
- BOM editor with Process Recipes
- Item type management (Meat, Dry Goods, Finish Good, Process)
- ECN workflow
- Machine/Calibration management

### Admin Panel
- User management
- Login activity tracking
- Session monitoring
- System-wide settings

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application
```bash
# Frontend (Next.js on port 5000)
cd apps/frontend && pnpm dev
```

### Future: Database Migrations (Prisma)
```bash
# Push schema to database
npm run db:push

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication
- Laravel Sanctum with session-based auth
- Same domain for frontend and backend
- 7 roles: Operator, Planner, Technical, Purchasing, Warehouse, QC, Admin

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Filament-like styling (neutral/slate color scheme)
- Base font size: 10px (1rem = 10px)
- Dark left sidebar
- Topbar with search and user avatar
- All text in English
- Lucide icons throughout

### 13-Step Workflow
1. Add Item to system
2. Create Process Recipe (multiple RM â†’ one PR)
3. Create Finish Product BOM (multiple items â†’ one FG)
4. Create PO or TO for items
5. Receive items in warehouse (GRN)
6. Move items between locations
7. Create Work Order (Planning)
8. Start Work Order (Production/Scanner)
9. Consume Stock (reserve items to WO)
10. Create Item from WO (against BOM)
11. Move items to Warehouse (putaway)
12. Close Work Order (consume, calculate yields)
13. Send Items Out (shipping/dispatch)

## Security Notes
- `.env` files are gitignored and never committed
- `.env.example` uses environment variable placeholders (${PGHOST}, ${PGPORT}, etc.)
- Database credentials are managed through Replit secrets
- All sensitive configuration uses environment variables

## Recent Changes

- 2025-10-09: **Scanner Module Workflow Enhancement - Separated Confirm & Create Actions**
  - **Workflow Separation**: Separated "Confirm Quantity" from "Create Item" into distinct actions
  - **New Flow**: Scan LP â†’ Enter Quantity â†’ Confirm â†’ Create Item (can repeat without rescanning)
  - **Repeat Functionality**: Users can create multiple items from same LP by confirming new quantities
  - **Quantity Lock**: Input disabled when confirmed to prevent accidental changes during creation
  - **UI Navigation**: Removed sidebar from scanner terminals, added back button in topbar
  - **Full-Width Layout**: Both terminals now display full-width without main app sidebar
  - **Process Terminal**: Blue "Confirm Quantity" button, then green "Create Process Recipe" button
  - **Pack Terminal**: Green "Confirm Quantity" button, then "Create Finished Good" button
