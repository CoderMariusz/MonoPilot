## Technical Tasks

### Backend

- [ ] Create `GET /api/warehouse/stock-moves` endpoint (enhanced)
  - Query parameters:
    - lp_id (filter by specific LP)
    - location_id (filter by from or to location)
    - movement_type (filter by type)
    - user_id (filter by user)
    - date_from, date_to (date range)
    - limit, offset (pagination)
  - Return: Array of stock_moves with related data (locations, users, LPs)
  - Order by: moved_at DESC (newest first)

- [ ] Create `GET /api/warehouse/stock-moves/lp/:id/history` endpoint
  - Return: Full movement history for specific LP (filters by lp_id)

- [ ] Implement filtering logic
  - Support multiple filters simultaneously
  - Efficient queries with proper joins and indexes

### Database

- [ ] Verify indexes on stock_moves:
  - idx_stock_moves_org_id
  - idx_stock_moves_lp_id
  - idx_stock_moves_from_location_id
  - idx_stock_moves_to_location_id
  - idx_stock_moves_movement_type
  - idx_stock_moves_moved_at
  - idx_stock_moves_moved_by_user_id
  - Composite index: (org_id, moved_at DESC) for efficient range queries

### Frontend

- [ ] Create `/warehouse/stock-moves` page
  - Table with sortable columns (click column header to sort)
  - Default sort: moved_at DESC (newest first)

- [ ] Create filter panel (left sidebar or top bar):
  - LP number search (auto-complete)
  - Location dropdown (multi-select)
  - Movement type checkboxes
  - User dropdown
  - Date range pickers (from_date, to_date, presets like "Last 7 days")

- [ ] Create movement detail panel:
  - Shows when row clicked
  - Can be modal or side panel
  - LP detail link
  - User info
  - Before/after state visualization (location icons with arrow)

**Note**: Statistics section, charts, and export are in Story 5.15b (Movement Statistics & Reporting)

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Filtering logic: lp_id, location_id, date range
- Sorting: moved_at ascending/descending
- Pagination: limit, offset

### Integration Tests
- GET /api/warehouse/stock-moves with various filters
- GET /api/warehouse/stock-moves/lp/:id/history
- Verify: correct results, correct ordering, pagination works

### E2E Tests
- Open /warehouse/stock-moves
- Filter by LP: LP-20250120-0001 → shows all movements of that LP
- Filter by location: WH-B-05 → shows all LPs moved to/from that location
- Filter by date: Last 7 days → shows only recent movements
- Filter by user: John Doe → shows only movements by John
- Sort by timestamp (ascending) → verify oldest first
- Click movement row → detail panel shows full record
- Multiple filters together → all filters applied (AND logic)
