# Story 6.3: Prevent Shipping Non-Passed LPs

## Goal
Block shipping of non-passed LPs to ensure only approved inventory ships.

## Acceptance Criteria
- LP with qa_status != 'passed' blocked from shipping (SO, TO)
- Error shown: "LP must have QA status: passed"
- Only passed LPs shown in picker
- **Phase 1 (Epic 6):** Implement qa_status validation logic in LP service
- **Phase 2 (Epic 7):** Integrate with shipping workflow when Epic 7 implemented

## Technical
- FR: QC-FR-03
- Prerequisites: Story 6.1
- **Note:** Full shipping integration deferred to Epic 7. This story implements:
  - LP service method: `validateLPForShipping(lpId)` returns error if qa_status != 'passed'
  - Filter helper: `getShippableLPs()` returns only passed LPs
  - These will be called by Epic 7 shipping workflows
