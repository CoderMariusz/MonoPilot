# Story 6.4: Control Consumption of Pending LPs

## Goal
Allow Admin to configure if pending LPs can be consumed in production.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Toggle: quality_settings.allow_consume_pending
- ON: production can consume pending LPs (with warning displayed)
- OFF: only passed LPs can be consumed (failed/quarantine always blocked)
- Default = OFF (strict mode)
- Warning message when consuming pending: "Warning: LP {number} has QA status 'pending' - not yet inspected"

## Technical
- FR: QC-FR-04
- Prerequisites: Story 6.1
- **Integration:** Story 4.9 (Consumption Enforcement) will call `validateLPForConsumption(lpId)`
- This story implements:
  - `getQualitySettings()` - returns allow_consume_pending value
  - `validateLPForConsumption(lpId)` - checks qa_status against settings
  - Returns: { allowed: boolean, warning?: string }
