================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
================================================================================

AGGRESSIVE (Recommended if market timing critical)
  Duration: 8-10 weeks
  Team: 3-4 engineers
  Risk: Medium

  Week 1-2:  Product Types (8) + Products (30) → 38 tests GREEN ✅
  Week 3-5:  BOMs (36) + Routings (27) → 101 tests GREEN ✅
  Week 6-7:  Costing (12) + Dashboard (12) → 125 tests GREEN ✅
  Week 8-10: Traceability (18) + Integration (12) → 155 tests GREEN ✅

COMFORTABLE (Recommended for long-term sustainability)
  Duration: 12-14 weeks
  Team: 2-3 engineers
  Risk: Low

PHASED MVP (Recommended for early customer feedback)
  Duration: 4-5 weeks (Phase 1)
  Team: 2 engineers
  Scope: Products + Types + Basic BOMs
  Gap: No Routing costs, no Traceability

================================================================================
CRITICAL PATH (STRICT ORDER)
================================================================================

MUST DO FIRST:
  1. Product Types (blocks Products form)
  2. Products (blocks all other modules)

THEN (can parallelize):
  3. BOMs + Routings (equal priority, low dependency)

THEN:
  4. Costing (depends on BOM + Routing costs)

THEN:
  5. Dashboard (independent, mostly done)
  6. Traceability (depends on production workflow)
  7. Integration (auto-resolves)

================================================================================
HIGH-VALUE FEATURES (⭐ STARS)
================================================================================

FEATURE 1: BOM Clone (FR-2.24)
  Impact: High - enables product variants in seconds
  Tests: 3 (TC-BOM-027 to TC-BOM-029)
  Effort: Medium (3 days)
  When: During BOM implementation (Week 3-4)
  Business Value: Massive time saver for food manufacturers

FEATURE 2: Routing Costs (ADR-009)
  Impact: CRITICAL - entire pricing engine depends on this
  Tests: 8 (TC-RTG-008, TC-RTG-023-24, TC-COST-004-7)
  Effort: High (5 days)
  When: During Routing + Costing implementation (Week 4-6)
  Business Value: Essential for accurate product pricing

FEATURE 3: BOM Cost Rollup (FR-2.36)
  Impact: High - calculate material + routing costs
  Tests: 2 (TC-BOM-032-033) + 8 costing tests
  Effort: High (requires integration with routing costs)
  When: After Routings done (Week 5-6)
  Business Value: Required for financial analysis

FEATURE 4: Recall Simulation (FR-2.62)
  Impact: High - regulatory/food safety critical
  Tests: 4 (TC-TRC-014 to TC-TRC-017)
  Effort: Very High (10-12 days for full traceability)
  When: Last (Week 8-10)
  Business Value: Legal compliance, customer safety

================================================================================

   - Enables Products module
   - Simple CRUD operations

2. Dashboard Performance (1 day) → 1 test GREEN

KEY SUCCESS FACTORS
================================================================================

1. STRICT ORDER
   Product Types → Products → BOMs + Routings → Costing → Dashboard → Traceability

2. RUN TESTS WEEKLY
   Friday test runs to verify progress
   No regressions allowed
   Track GREEN test count

3. IMPLEMENT BY TEST
   Each test is your specification
   Make failing test GREEN
   Move to next test

4. CODE REVIEW RIGOROUSLY
   Verify no regressions
   Check multi-tenant isolation (RLS)
   Validate business logic

5. PARALLELIZE CAREFULLY
   Only BOMs + Routings can parallelize
   Everything else is sequential
   Clear dependencies
