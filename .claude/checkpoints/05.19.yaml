blockers:
  - "No ScannerReceiveService"
  - "No scanner API routes (6 endpoints needed)"
  - "No scanner page or components"
  - "No validation schemas"
  - "No tests"

recommendation: |
  Excellent story preparation (full spec + 5 context files), zero implementation.
  All 8 dependencies satisfied. Full implementation needed:
  1. Create ScannerReceiveService with 7 methods
  2. Create 6 API routes (scanner receive, lookup, validate)
  3. Create scanner-receive validation schemas
  4. Build 5-step scanner wizard (15+ components)
  5. Implement audio/haptic feedback
  6. Write comprehensive tests
