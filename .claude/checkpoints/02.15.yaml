status: PARTIAL

recommendation: |
  Story 02.15 is 85% complete. Frontend done, DB migration missing.

  DONE:
  - Services: cost-history-service.ts + variance-analysis-service.ts
  - API: 2 endpoints (history + variance report)
  - Components: 10 UI components with all states
  - Page: Cost history page at /technical/costing/products/:id/history
  - Hooks: React Query integration
  - Types: Complete definitions

  CRITICAL BLOCKER:
  - cost_variances table migration MISSING
  - Variance report API will fail at runtime

  MISSING:
  - Export API endpoint (POST /history/export)
  - PDF/PNG/Excel export (only CSV)
