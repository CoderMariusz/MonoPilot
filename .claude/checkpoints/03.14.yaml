details:
  deferral_reason: "Blocked on Epic 04 (Production) and Epic 05 (Warehouse/Inventory)"
  hard_dependencies:
    - "Epic 04: Line capacity, shift schedules, machine availability (~60% complete)"
    - "Epic 05: License Plate inventory for material availability (not started)"
  database_schema: "NOT CREATED - 3 tables, 2 functions, triggers missing"
  schedule_optimization_engine: "0% - Algorithm not implemented"
  api_endpoints: "0% - Optimize/Apply/Capacity endpoints missing"
  ui_components: "0% - Modal, Heatmap, Conflict dialog missing"

recommendation: |
  Story 03.14 is DEFERRED and essentially unstarted.
  Only the foundation (Story 03.15 Gantt View) is ~85% complete.

  CANNOT PROCEED UNTIL:
  1. Epic 04 (Production) is complete - capacity validation
  2. Epic 05 (Warehouse/Inventory) is complete - material validation
  3. Database schema is created

  Estimated effort when unblocked: 7-10 days

next_phase: BLOCKED
